# Seesaw Logic Simulation

This project is a pure JavaScript simulation of a seesaw mechanism, demonstrating physics logic (torque calculation) and DOM manipulation without external libraries.

## Features
- **Core Logic:** Calculates torque based on weight x distance.
- **Visuals:** Pure CSS animations for tilting.
- **Persistence:** Uses LocalStorage to save state.
- **Bonus:** Visual grid ruler and audio feedback using Web Audio API.

## How to Run
Simply open `index.html` or view the live demo.
